description: Interested in working with Wieben on a track?
---

A Wieben production is raw, warm, and a little rough around the edges.  When working with artists, I like to get to the core of what makes your music work, and figure out how to best reflect that with production, arrangement, and mixing.  I want the music to be authentic to you and stand the test of time, not to conform to whatever is charting.  If you're interested in getting a  creative with it, send me a message via [email](mailto:aidengwiebe@gmail.com) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wiebenmusic/) and we'll make it happen.  

<h4>Tape Master</h4>
If you're interested in lo-fi tape saturation, I can master your project using casette or reel-to-reel tape.  $70 CAD per track, or $300 CAD per album.<br>
