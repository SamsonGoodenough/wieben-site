<h4>Production</h4>
A Wieben production is raw, warm, and a little rough around the edges.  When working with artists, I like to get to the core of what makes your music work, and figure out how to best reflect that in your production, arrangements, and mix.  I want the music to be authentic to you and stand the test of time, not to conform to whatever is charting.  If you're interested in creating a project together, send me a message via [email](mailto:aidengwiebe@gmail.com) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wiebenmusic/) and we'll make it happen.  

<h4>Mixing</h4>
Mixing is my specialty.  Send me stems or tracks and I'll do my thing.  I like to focus on creating a detailed mix that rewards focused headphone listening.  This is ideal for selling physical copies and generating a passionate fanbase who will actually talk about how much they love your music.  Using a mixture of in-the-box and analogue techniques, a Wieben mix will make your music stand out as something unique.   $25 CAD/hr

<h4>Tape Mastering</h4>
I can master your project using cassette or reel-to-reel tape, if you're after that lo-fi saturated sound.  $70 CAD per track, or $150 CAD per album.<br>
