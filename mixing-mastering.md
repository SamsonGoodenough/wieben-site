<h4>Traditional record production ($100-$300 per song) </h4>
I will see your song to completion!  I can critique songwriting, record new parts, book studios and session players, and provide a streaming-ready mix and master.  Price varies depending on the amount of work required of me.  Price is fully negotiable for full-length projects.  

<h4>Singular track ($60 per track)</h4>
I can write and record guitar, bass, or perc/FX parts for your song.  I also ask for a songwriter credit if my part becomes integral to the song.
