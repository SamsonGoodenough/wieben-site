Mixing and mastering is an **ever-changing process** for both engineers and artists. I want to work with you to **make your music sound exactly how you envision it sounding**. If you have your music recorded, I can mix and master the audio to a high quality ready to uploaded and distributed digitally or physically.

All songs come with **unlimited revisions until you are completely pleased with how the song sounds** and you are ready to release it into the world. I do quality work for competitive rates. [Reach out and letâ€™s make it happen](mailto:aidengwiebe@gmail.com).
