<h4>On-Site Multitrack Recording</h4>
Ever played such a hype show you wished you got recorded?  Phone mics in the audience not doing you justice?  I'll mic up your band with studio-grade equipment, and mix it until it feels like how it felt live.  What you do with the recordings is up to you.. release a live album, use it for promo content, or review the footage to improve your musicianship!  As a bonus, I'll also be your sound tech, mixing for the house with some gnarly Soundtoys plugins.  Send me a message via [email](mailto:aidengwiebe@gmail.com) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wiebenmusic/) and we'll make it happen.  

**Gear Used:**<br>
*AEA R92 Ribbon for the warmest of guitar tones*<br>
*Avantone CK-7 Large Diaphram Condenser for crispiest of overheads*<br>
*Tascam 8p Dyna Microphone Preamp*<br>
*Logic Pro*<br>

<h4>Mixing</h4>
Mixing is my specialty.  Send me stems or tracks and I'll do my thing.  Depending on the song, I'll focus on creating a mix that excells in whatever environment your music will be played.  Whether you need a mix that'll hit on a long drive with friends, or something that rewards detailed headphone listening, I'm your guy.  Using a mixture of in-the-box and analogue techniques, a Wieben mix will make your music stand out as something unique.   $25 CAD/hr. 

<h4>Tape Mastering</h4>
I can master your project using cassette or reel-to-reel tape, if you're after that lo-fi saturated sound.  $70 CAD per track, or $150 CAD per album.<br>

**Gear Used:** <br>
*TEAC 3340 Reel to reel*<br>
*TAYA Cassette tape deck*<br>
