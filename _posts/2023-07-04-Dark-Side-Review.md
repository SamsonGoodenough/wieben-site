I don't think there's a such thing as a perfect album, but *Dark Side of the Moon* is my favourite. Grand, conceptual themes come at the cost of having weaker moments. The noisy transition into "Time", the repetitiveness of "Us and Them". Pink Floyd could have focused on making each track equally as strong as the last, but that would have deprived the album of its dynamics and its incredible ending.

*Dark Side of the Moon* is one of those albums that is greater than the sum of its parts. "Eclipse" feels like such a triumphant, cathartic closer because of everything that came before. Similarly, "Breathe" works as such a soothing opener because of the short collage piece that precedes it. *Dark Side* is a masterclass in album sequencing, even factoring in the moment of silence the listener will take to flip the record.

On top of this, the production and mixing is probably the best I've ever heard. The way the keyboard and rhythm guitar are juxtaposed on opposite sides of the stereo calls attention to the subtlest details of the band's performance. *Dark Side* also doesn't shy away from bold post-production effects, adding an extra layer to the album for me to appreciate. And unlike full-on psychedelic rock, these effects are used sparingly and only when it serves the performance.

There are countless more factors that make *Dark Side of the Moon* what it is, but those are the ones I appreciate the most. *Dark Side* is one of the most picked-apart pieces of music in human history, and one could spend hours describing the intricacies of every lyric and every solo. This album has something for everyone, and for me, that's its sequencing, production, and ambition.
