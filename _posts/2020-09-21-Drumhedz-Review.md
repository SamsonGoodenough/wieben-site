Chris Dave's first solo album is a concept album on the power of music- which would be a very cheesy message if it didn't deliver with some of the most powerful songs I've ever heard. This project is perhaps the best to come out of the Soulquarian collective, almost two decades since their prime. Even though this project is missing some of the key members, Chris Dave managed to bring together many of the Soulquarian legends (Bilal, Shafiq Husayn, Pino Palladino, and James Poyser) with a new wave of west coast session musicians, plus Anderson .Paak and Elzhi for vocals. This album is the same sort of blend of neo-soul, hip hop, jazz, funk, and psychedelia the Soulquarians pioneered, but Chris Dave pushes it even further into jazz rhythms and psychedelic effects.

The album begins with an atmospheric, spacey opener that transitions into a dark funk rock groove, lead by Daveâ€™s stellar drumming. Delay and feedback pile on top of the instruments, reminding me of some of the more experimental Hendrix and Funkadelic tracks. The heavy psychedelic rock touches on this album are what set it apart from other albums like it. "Black Hole" is a flawless funk track, not unlike something off *Mama's Gun*. "Whatever" is another highlight, going for a more subdued, neo-soul sound. "Clear View" is my favourite track of the bunch, with an emotional performance from Anderson .Paak, and dark, shifting instrumentation to match. The beat switch towards the end of the track never fails to give me goosebumps.

As a session musician himself, Chris Dave puts some relatively unknown vocalists and musicians up against the popular features he has access to, perfectly showcasing what everyone has to offer. Every corner of this album has a talented musician playing their heart out. It's a miracle that this album comes off as cohesive as it does while maintaining such a diverse and complex sound.

My one problem is that "Trippy Tipsy" isn't longer. It had great potential to be a 10 minute jazz-rock closer.
