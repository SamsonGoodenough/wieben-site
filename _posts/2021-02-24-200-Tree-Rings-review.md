*200 Tree Rings* is ambitious, concise, and has some fantastic features and creative production.  Going into this record, I was immediately blown away by "Title Sequence": a gorgeous, drumless intro.  It works as an incredible tone-setter, and leads perfectly into the next track.

It was here, however, that I realized this album was not going to live up to its potential.  "Invisible Force" has a really cool and dark melody, but the beat does a poor job of matching that energy.  The drums are quite far back in the mix, leaving a light harpsichord with the responsibility of driving the track.  Most of the tracks on this album have the same issue where something feels missing.  Everything taken individually sounds fantastic, but the majority of this album just feels empty in some way or another.  With "Conclusion", *200 Tree Rings* reminds me of what it could have been.  The closer is even more beautiful than the opener, with a melancholic choir serving as the main backdrop, transitioning into a classical-style piano as the track fades out.  Even still though, the drum machine sounds pasted on and fails to find any cohesion in the rest of the beat.  It leaves me wishing more care was put into this album.. it was close, but didn't quite make it.
