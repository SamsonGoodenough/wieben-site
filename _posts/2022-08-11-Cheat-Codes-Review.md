*Cheat Codes* is a turning point for Black Thought, frontman of The Roots, and one of the most acclaimed rappers of all time. Next to the crackling samples and sloppy gang vocals of other '90s groups, The Roots were one of the cleanest hip-hop acts of their time. Their use of live instrumentation was a big factor in their sound. The Roots are still respected in hip hop and the greater music community to this day, but they've failed to stay on the cutting edge of new releases. By the 2010s, The Roots were no longer achieving the same critical appeal. While still recording ambitious projects, their sound became cleaner and more palletable for a general audience. At the same time, they now serve as the live band on the Tonight Show, which may bring into question their 'authenticity'.  While authenticity doesn't really matter, this is a trajectory many artists will follow.  When a carreer goes this direction, I naturally start looking elsewhere for inspiring new music.

Danger Mouse has had a similar career trajectory. Starting out as an incredible producer for MCs like Prince Po and MF DOOM, he gradually drifted towards cleaner sounds. From Gnarls Barkley to the Black Keys and U2, Danger Mouse has delved into pop and alternative rock throughout his career. Though he has continued to produce the odd hip hop track, many may doubt if he is still interested in producing traditional hip hop like he used to.

This is why *Cheat Codes* is such a shocking moment as both a Black Thought and a Danger Mouse record. The clean live instrumentation typical of Black Thought has been traded out for dirty distorted samples, courtesy of Danger Mouse. The beat selection on this record sounds like 60s psychedelic soul with the low-mids turned up to 11. Black Thought's voice is altered with digital distortion to fit with the instrumentals, and everything seems clouded in a subtle reverb, glueing the two opposites together. The instrumentals are more than simple 2-bar loops. From the trembling snares in the title track to the atmospheric vibraphones on "Identical Deaths", the instrumentals feel alive and dynamic. The instrumentals on here can stand on their own, and are often given time to shine. The second half of "Identical Deaths" has the instrumental slowly overtaken by the sound of a bustling train station. The opener, "Sometimes", ends in a similar way, extending the vocal sample into a mellow ending. This album also brings in singers like Michael Kiwanuka for some great hooks that feel almost like samples themselves. As a final comment, it is a miracle Russ fits in on this album, since his normal sound is so much different to what he delivers on "Because". 

Overall, the quality and consistency of the production match Black Thought's excellent lyricism and rapping. *Cheat Codes* is a great collaboration, and a stand-out release in the legendary discographies of both Black Thought and Danger Mouse.
