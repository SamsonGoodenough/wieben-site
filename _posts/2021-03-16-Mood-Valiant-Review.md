Ever since I heard Hiatus Kaiyote's first two albums, I've been anticipating a follow-up. I have never been this excited for an album release, and the payoff was definitely worth it. Unlike their last project, which was focused on complex electronic synth work, *Mood Valiant* is a warm exploration through a tropical setting of birds and flowers. "Get Sun" nails this vibe with a strong inspiration from MPB (m√∫sica popular Brasileira), especially due to Arthur Verocai's involvement. The offbeat acoustic guitar part takes a lot of inspiration from Brazillian music too. There are many other similarities to be made here, from the intricacies of Clever Austin's drumming to the faint cuica at the end, but the song is so dense it would take forever to describe everything going on.  The opener, "Flight of the Tiger Lily", also repurposes Verocai's arangements into a twisting, humid landscape, setting the mood for the rest of the album.

The thing Hiatus Kaiyote does best is layers. All across *Mood Valiant*, Nai's vocals pile on top of each other, supported by unique, vintage synths that sound as if they are mimicking her unique tone of voice. Heavy amounts of tape saturation turn the record into a hot accumulation of instruments and sound effects. The sound design on *Mood Valiant* is extraordinary, somehow consolidating dozens of distinct sounds and instruments into gorgeous songs, all without devolving into noise.

Each song is full of interesting ideas, even if some are stronger than others. "And We Go Gentle" and "Blood and Marrow", while interesting, seem a bit lacking compared to the other incredible tracks on this album. "Sparkle Tape Break Up", on the other hand, is a favourite of mine. I love the warped background vocals and the super swung groove. "Rose Water" is another highlight, thanks to the infectious quintuplet drum pattern. The distorted piano fade-out is also a great way to end the track.

This review also wouldn't be complete without mentioning "Stone or Lavender". It's very different from Hiatus Kaiyote's usual brand of progressive soul, instead opting for a string-backed piano ballad with a powerful lead vocal. The lyrics are some of Nai's most emotional and thoughtful, inspired by her battle with cancer.  But while I do love the song, the way it is produced has it sitting as a weak point.  If it sounded more honest and less operatic, it might deliver the potent emotional sting the song has the potential for.  As it stands, it seems more like a passable popstar imperssion.  

So I have mixed opinions, but "Mood Valiant" is still quite beloved and inspiring for me.  Not to mention a great way to introduce western audiences to Brazillian music.
