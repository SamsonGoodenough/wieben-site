One of the greatest inventions of the modern era would have to be voice memos.  Musicians of all skill levels and income statuses can suddenly capture what they truly sound like behind closed doors.  We have also had superstars like Billie Eilish gain their following on the merits of their authenticity, selling an image of the authentic artist.  So if authenticity sells, ALL MUST BUY *The Glory of the Spring*.  Imagine if all those little untitled voice memos were completed, arranged, and released?  Hunter isn't giving us a polished facade with this album.  Down to the hand-drawn cover, this is her creative spirit shown as plainly as possible.  These song are all so emotionally potent, elevated by the perfectly-placed dissonant harmonies.  You can hear the opressive sound of the 4-corner room *The Glory of Spring* was recorded in, as Hunter laments in the silence of her God.  Minimal without being boring, raw without being messy.  HUNTER STULL. Really great stuff.
