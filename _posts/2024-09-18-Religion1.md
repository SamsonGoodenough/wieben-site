Religions are belief systems that can bring an individual closer to the divine without any understanding of what the divine actually is.  It necessarily operates on faith, and because of this, can lead to wildly inaccurate views of reality.  In a proper religious journey though, the believer will come to better understand the divine by experiencing it.  Overall, religion persists into the modern age because of its usefulness to mankind, the pleasure it brings, and its ease of adoption when compared to more complicated world-views.  While I don't actually belive in God, in comparing religions and finding consistent descriptions of the divine, I must conclude that all thriving religions have an element of truth to them.  The most interesting question to ask about any religious belief is then: “How is this meaningfully true?”

<h3>Belief Systems</h3>
A belief system is a logic web.  It is a series of conclusions that make sense when you briefly consider it.  The accuracy of a belief system always depends on faith.  If you examine a belief system for long enough, you will see the faith upon which it is anchored.  If you examine the faith, the belief system will be threatened.  Unthreatened belief systems become a feedback loop, where reality is interpreted through the lens of the system, which then increases the complexity of the web.  The more complex the belief system, the more difficult it is to untangle.  

<h3>Faith</h3>
Faith is trusting a process before outcomes can be observed.  Any religion requires an understanding of faith, and will provide an answer for where faith belongs.  Faith can be placed in an omnipotent being, fate, or any number of metaphysical constructions.  Finding the most deserving place for my faith has been my meta-journey as I’ve explored the truth behind different religions.  Ultimately, one's own senses are the best place for faith to rest.  Everything we know about the world has been subjected to our mental biases, and this explains how different observers can have different beliefs about reality.  With this knowledge, I must have faith that my senses are accurate, or I relinquish my ability to know anything at all.  Trusting your senses gives you data and the scientific method.  The more I interrogate my biases and test my sense data, the closer I get to understanding reality as it is.  

<h3>The Divine</h3>
The divine is an experience, not a being.  Because it is not a being, it is notoriously difficult to explain.  It has been described as God, a state of mind, life flashing before one's eyes, a spiritual presence, etc.  All descriptions of the divine experience are equally valid, and commonalities between descriptions should be explored.  In exploring the divine with multiple lenses, it always seems beyond reality, and it feels beautiful.  If the divine does not exist in reality, one must abandon reality in order to experience it.  Also, as beauty is subjective, the appearance of the divine is determined by what you find most beautiful.  Some see it as nature, some see it as a loving paternal or maternal figure.  I see it as a narrative, where I fail to percieve time, and I can simultaneously fathom where I have come from, how my experiences have shaped me, and where they are leading me.  Experiencing the story of my life from a disembodied perspective, but with every first-hand detail, is nothing short of pure beauty.  This has given me so much insight on my life to where I no longer need divine experience to achieve this level of understanding.  I have not desired a divine experience in a while, and so I cannot experience it anymore.  If I wanted another divine experince, I'm sure I could do it again.
