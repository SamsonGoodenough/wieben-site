Aiden has a fascination for the history of recorded music. He shares in the late 1960s mentality of 'using the studio as an instrument', inspired by legendary producers George Martin and Teo Macero.  Aiden likes his music sounding raw and disorienting.  Heavy saturation, mono reverbs, and hard panning are part of what makes a Wieben production.  This style suits jazz, rock, soul, and hip hop, where the boldness of the mix can compliment confident, dynamic musicianship.  He brings creativity and attention-to-detail to every level of the production process.  **Aiden believes great songs are made when each step, no matter how technical, is working for the glory of the music.**

Wieben is his brand.  As an ambitious creative at heart, Aiden created Wieben Productions so he would not need to depend on labels and studios to create.  Its not a pseudonym, but a **one-man company that puts art above profit**.  Based in London, Ontario, Wieben is focused on the ethical provision of audio services for artists.   

Aiden has completed a BA in Popular Music Studies at Western University, and continues to contribute to his local music scene in London.  Within one year of joining funk-fusion band **[Juice Joint](https://www.instagram.com/juicejointband/)**, he has already been asked to perform at **Sunfest** and **Aeolian Jazz Festival**, and to record at EMAC and OIART studios.  **Juice Joint** also host a biweekly jam night, which brings together dozens of instrumentalists and vocalists from the jazz and hip hop communities in his city.  With indie rock artist **[Sam Hansell](https://www.instagram.com/ham_sansell/)**, Aiden has planned and performed a sold-out show for *Inopia*, the debut album that they produced together.  Whether its creating a record to stand the test of time or playing a show for hundreds of people, Aiden is fully dedicated to his craft.
