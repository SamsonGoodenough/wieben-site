When made with intention, an album can become a cultural artifact that reflects the values and aesthetics of the people who created it.  This is my intention when I make music.  A bit of it comes through on *Inopia*; the project was the result of an unlikely pairing between Sam Hansell and myself (thank you to Emanuella Stratas for making it happen!).  We had 24/7 access to practice rooms and all of our multi-instrumentalist friends.  It sounds like Western's Music Building, where progressive punk bands and piano majors rehearse under the same roof.  It was overly ambitious, and we rushed it out within the year.  I think this all comes through on the project.  It's not winning awards, but I'm forever glad it exists.  For me, *Inopia* is how I want to remember my university days.  

*Juice Joint* is Nathan's house: recorded in his living room and mixed in his bedroom.  I was new to the band and still figuring out my parts, and despite re-recording my Grapevine solo dozens of times (will my final comp ever see the light of day?), we went with the second take.  *Juice Joint* is up-and-coming London musicians filtered through Nathan's vision of soundtrack-inspired lofi jazz.  This album is what happens when everyone is trying to 'make it' as artists without budgets.  The cover art was even made as payment following an unpaid gig.  

Music made with the purpose of selling money or showing off doesn't interest me.  I want my music to inspire creativity and emotion, so going forward, I want to work on projects that have creativty and emotion at a foundational level.  When I am hired to produce, I want to capture and amplify the strengths in your music, band, or message.  I hope that I'll one day produce an album effectively enough to where it can stand on its own merits and be loved for decades.
