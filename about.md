Whenever music is on, I'm compelled to listen actively.  It's a blessing and a curse, because I've fallen in love with recorded music as an art form, but it's also the most distracting thing in the world.  Depicting complicated ideas through a medium as immaterial as sound is my eternal challenge.  I love music that confuses me, and forces me to learn how to understand it.  This led me to love abstract, intricate genres that can mix storytelling, experimental production styles, and rich musical tradition.  *[Red Burns](https://standingonthecorner.bandcamp.com/album/red-burns)* is my favourite album ever for these reasons; I still don't understand it, but I get closer with each listen.  

I became disillusioned with my hometown of London, my church, and my school, but everything has good in it if you look hard enough.  The music scene in London in particular has been the most meaningful, yet painstaking endeavor of my life so far.  Whatever I work on, I try to make it my everything and see it to the end.  I also get too attached to things, often to my own detriment.  Right now, I'm pouring all I have into the record I'm making for Forest City Gallery's **[post-bop beathead workshop](https://www.forestcitygallery.com/post/fcg-s-postbop-beathead-jazz-workshop-sponsored-by-lbmx)**.  

My depression has brought me close to God a few times, and trying to understand my experiences brought me to philosophy.  It answers the 'why's and 'how's better than religion or school ever could, and I owe my own sanity to the practice.  It helped me turn music from escapism to inspiration, and now there's nothing more personally fufilling than creating art.  At the end of the day, I'm a community member who gives as much as possible to support art in this city.  I am a record producer, founding member of Mistapes (Western University's student record label), session musician at EMAC and OIART studios, media technician at Village Green Community Church, and a creator of Juice Joint's biweekly jam nights at The Poachers Arms.
