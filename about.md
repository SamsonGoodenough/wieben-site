I fell in love with music at the age of 13 when I stopped taking guitar lessons.  Once I discovered how to teach myself, the world of music production opened up to me.  I started listening (a lot), and immersing myself in recorded music as an art form.  Inspired by legendary producers like Slauson Malone, Teo Macero, and my university mentor Jay Hodgson, **I believe that great songs are made when each step, no matter how technical, is working for the glory of the music.**

I dedicate myself passionately to my local music scene here in London.  Within one year of joining funk-fusion band **[Juice Joint](https://www.instagram.com/juicejointband/)**, we've already been asked to perform at **Sunfest** and **Aeolian Jazz Festival**, and to record at EMAC and OIART studios.  Modeled off the jazz scene in Toronto, **Juice Joint** also created a 'no-barriers' jam night at The Poacher's Arms called **Juice Jams**.  On a biweekly basis, we bring together dozens of instrumentalists and vocalists across the jazz, latin, and hip hop communities in the city.  

I was also a founding member of Mistapes Records, Western University's student record label.  We selected, marketed, produced an album release for indie rock artist **[Sam Hansell](https://www.instagram.com/ham_sansell/)**.  *Inopia*, the debut album we produced together, released with a sold-out show and fans who already knew the lyrics.  Whether I'm creating a record to stand the test of time or putting on a show for hundreds of people, I am fully dedicated to my craft.  

*Thank you for reading!*
