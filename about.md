When made with intention, an album can become a cultural artifact that reflects the values and aesthetics of the people who created it.  This is my dream when I make music.  A bit of this idea came through on *Inopia*; the project was the result of an unlikely pairing between Sam Hansell and myself (thank you to Emanuella for making it happen!).  We had 24/7 access to practice rooms and all of our multi-instrumentalist friends.  It sounds like the culture of our music faculty, where progressive punk bands, talented songwriters, and piano majors were all rehearsing under the same roof.  The project isn't winning awards, but I'm forever glad it exists.  It was incredible seeing London appreciate the album firsthand.  The CDs sold out immediately and you'd see a Sam Hansell shirt at every punk show for the following year.  *Inopia* is my best memory from university.  

*Juice Joint* is Nathan's house: recorded in his living room and mixed in his bedroom.  I was new to the band and still figuring out my parts, and despite re-recording my Grapevine solo dozens of times (will my final comp ever see the light of day?), we went with the second take.  *Juice Joint* is up-and-coming London musicians filtered through Nathan's vision of soundtrack-inspired lofi jazz.  This album is what happens when everyone is trying to 'make it' as artists without budgets.  Even the cover art was made for us as payment for a gig.  It established Juice Joint as London's leading instrumental band, resulting in Sunfest, artist collaborations, and the weekly open jam we host at Poachies.  

My personal experience with both of these projects are why I love them so much.  If you take away the subjectivity though, you're left with some pretty cool albums that are held back by logistical issues.  They have taught me the value of having a strong creative vision, and the importance of executing it intentionally.  I become a better producer with each project, and I hope that by working ethically in my community/industry/scene, I can help others make music that they can forever be proud of.
