I fell in love with music at the age of 13 when I stopped taking guitar lessons.  Once I discovered how to teach myself, the world of music production opened up to me.  I started listening (a lot), and immersing myself in recorded music as an art form.  Inspired by legendary producers like George Martin, Teo Macero, and my mentor at Western Jay Hodgeson, **I believe that great songs are made when each step, no matter how technical, is working for the glory of the music.**

Wieben is my brand.  I created Wieben so I wouldn't have to depend on labels and studios to create.  It's not a pseudonym, but a **one-man company that puts art above profit**.  Based in London, Ontario, Wieben is focused on the ethical provision of audio services for artists.  I like to focus on everything technical— mixing (live or in the studio), recording, producing— and doing so at a flat rate without taking royalties.  

I've completed a BA in Popular Music Studies at Western University, and continue to contribute to my local music scene in London.  Within one year of joining funk-fusion band **[Juice Joint](https://www.instagram.com/juicejointband/)**, we've already been asked to perform at **Sunfest** and **Aeolian Jazz Festival**, and to record at EMAC and OIART studios.  **Juice Joint** also hosts a biweekly jam night, which brings together dozens of instrumentalists and vocalists from the jazz and hip hop communities in the city.  With indie rock artist **[Sam Hansell](https://www.instagram.com/ham_sansell/)**, I've planned and performed a sold-out show for *Inopia*, the debut album we produced together.  Whether I'm creating a record to stand the test of time or playing a show for hundreds of people, I am fully dedicated to my craft.  

*Thank you for reading!*
