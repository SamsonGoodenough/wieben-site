Aiden has a fascination for the history of recorded music. He shares in the late 1960s mentality of 'using the studio as an instrument', inspired by legends like George Martin and Teo Macero.  Aiden likes his music sounding raw and disorienting.  Heavy saturation, mono reverbs, and hard panning are part of what makes a Wieben production.  This style suits jazz, rock, soul, and hip hop, where the boldness of the mix can compliment confident, dynamic musicianship.  He brings creativity and attention-to-detail to every level of the production process.  **Aiden believes great songs are made when each step, no matter how technical, is working for the glory of the music.**

**His debut album, *Awareness*, is an excersize in improvisation.**  Inspired by records like *Saucerful of Secrets* by Pink Floyd and *On The Corner* by Miles Davis, *Awareness* was conceived live in the studio, and edited down into its best parts.  Written with percussionist and friend Manuel Thomas, this record has a strong emphasis on rhythm and groove.  Each track features multiple layers of percussion instruments, drawing also from spiritual jazz and Brazilian tropicalia.  *Awareness* perseveres in an economy that pressures bands to get smaller and less experimental.  If you enjoy music that may be unorthodox, Aiden's debut album might be what you need.  [Read more on the thought process behind *Awareness* on his blog.](wieben.ca/awareness)

Aiden is currently finishing up a BA in Popular Music Studies at Western University.  **He gigs regularly in the London area, most notably as a guitarist in funk fusion band [Juice Joint](https://www.instagram.com/juicejointband/) or as the a bassist for indie rock artist [Sam Hansell](https://www.instagram.com/ham_sansell/).**  He is also an advisor on all things sound at Village Green Church.  He is always open to working with new people and contributing to his local music scene in Southwestern Ontario.
