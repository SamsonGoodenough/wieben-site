I fell in love with music when I finally stopped taking guitar lessons.  Once I discovered how to teach myself, the world of music production opened up to me.  I started listening (a lot), and immersing myself in recorded music as an art form.  Inspired by legendary producers like Slauson Malone, Teo Macero, and my university mentor Jay Hodgson, **I believe that great songs are made when each step, no matter how technical, is working for the glory of the music.**  I dedicate myself passionately and creatively to whatever I am working on.  My current project is with **[Forest City Gallery](https://www.forestcitygallery.com/)**. Following their **[post-bop beathead workshop](https://www.forestcitygallery.com/post/fcg-s-postbop-beathead-jazz-workshop-sponsored-by-lbmx)**, I am turning 5 days of recordings into a 40-minute ambient-jazz vinyl record.  The project will also feature extra musicians I have selected from my circle in the underground London scene.  

I also give back to the London scene as much as I can.  Everything I do in **[Juice Joint](https://www.instagram.com/juicejointband/)** is to support the community.  We record at OIART for the mutual benefit of providing their students with a band to engineer for.  Modeled off the jazz scene in Toronto, **[Juice Joint](https://www.instagram.com/juicejointband/)** also created a 'no-barriers' jam night at The Poacher's Arms, for a night to improve our skills in community with other musciains.  Juice Jams are still ongoing, organized by **[Nathan Nykor](https://www.instagram.com/nathanjuicebox/)**.  I was also a founding member of **[Mistapes Records](https://www.instagram.com/mistapesrecords/)**, Western University's student-run record label.  The label is structured to provide students with the experience of working for a real record label.  In **[Mistapes's](https://www.instagram.com/mistapesrecords/)** first year, I operated as executive producer for *Inopia*, **[Sam Hansell's](https://www.instagram.com/ham_sansell/)** debut record.  The album released with a sold-out show and fans who already knew the lyrics.  

I love trying to understand difficult concepts.  Abstract pieces of music, the mind, divinity, and how I can fit into the music scene and the world at large.  This eventually brought me to philosophy, with a specific fascination with the nature of belief.  I am curently working to pivot from the music industry to the world of academia, and nothing in my life has felt more right and hopeful.
