I fell in love with music at the age of 13 when I stopped taking guitar lessons.  Once I discovered how to teach myself, the world of music production opened up to me.  I started listening (a lot), and immersing myself in recorded music as an art form.  Inspired by legendary producers like Slauson Malone, Teo Macero, and my university mentor Jay Hodgson, **I believe that great songs are made when each step, no matter how technical, is working for the glory of the music.**

I am a sound artist.  I love injecting creativity in places where there typically is none.  I bring a music-first mentality to mixing, recording, and marketing.  Wieben is halfway between a pseudonym and a one-man company; the name is reserved for any music that I'm proud to have been a part of.  In other words, **Wieben is a brand that values art above profit.**  My latest project, which I am extremely proud to be involved with, is with **Forest City Gallery**. Following their "post-bop beathead workshop", I am turning 5 days of recordings into a 40-minute ambient-jazz vinyl record.  

I dedicate myself passionately to my local music scene here in London.  Within one year of joining funk-fusion band **[Juice Joint](https://www.instagram.com/juicejointband/)**, we've already been asked to perform at **Sunfest** and to record at EMAC and OIART studios.  Modeled off the jazz scene in Toronto, **Juice Joint** also created a 'no-barriers' jam night at The Poacher's Arms.  On a biweekly basis, we bring together dozens of musicians across the jazz, latin, and hip hop communities in the city for a night to improve our skills and meet new people.  

I was also a founding member of Mistapes Records, Western University's student record label.  We selected, marketed, produced an album release for indie rock artist **[Sam Hansell](https://www.instagram.com/ham_sansell/)**.  *Inopia*, the debut album we produced together, released with a sold-out show and fans who already knew the lyrics.  Whether I'm creating a record to stand the test of time or putting on a show for hundreds of people, I am fully dedicated to my craft.  

*Thank you for reading!*
