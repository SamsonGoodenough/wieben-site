Borderline personality disorder appeared suddenly at 23.  I quit everything, moved out, spent all my savings, and my personality fractured.  For 2 months, I was one of three people: an artist named Needles, his tortured muse named White Eyes, or something else.  There was a lot of self harm, and the hospital only made it worse.  I can't even say what month I went in, but it was 2025.  The personalities are gone now, but now I seldom recognize myself when I look in the mirror.  I like it this way; being hard to know carries with it unstable relationship patterns.  This is the greatest way to alleviate pain in my life, yet I sincerely apologize to those I have ended contact with.  Fortunately, the personality breaks have shortened and occur infrequently.  When they do occur, I put it into an unreleased art project called *gotosleep*.  

If you're instead here to work with me, this does not negatively affect my professional life.  [Read my professional bio here.](http://wieben.ca/professional-bio)

My heart goes out to anyone else who struggles with self-destructive tendencies.  I'm sorry.
