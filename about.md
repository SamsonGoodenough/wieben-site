I fell in love with music when I finally stopped taking guitar lessons.  Once I discovered how to teach myself, the world of music production opened up to me.  I started listening (a lot), and immersing myself in recorded music as an art form.  Inspired by legendary producers like Slauson Malone, Teo Macero, and my undergrad mentor Jay Hodgson, **I believe that great songs are made when each step, no matter how technical, is working for the glory of the music.**  I dedicate myself passionately and creatively to whatever I am working on.  My current project is with Forest City Gallery.  Following their **[post-bop beathead workshop](https://www.forestcitygallery.com/post/fcg-s-postbop-beathead-jazz-workshop-sponsored-by-lbmx)**, I am turning 5 days of recordings into a 40-minute ambient-jazz vinyl record.  The project will also feature extra musicians I have selected from my circle in the underground London scene.  

Everything I do in **[Juice Joint](https://www.instagram.com/juicejointband/)** is to support the community and challenge myself as a musician.  Modeled off the jazz scene in Toronto, we host a 'no-barriers' jam night at The Poacher's Arms, for a night to improve our skills in community with other musciains.  We also record at OIART for the mutual benefit of providing their students with a band to engineer for.  The jams have been continuing on a weekly basis, now run by **[Nathan Nykor](https://www.instagram.com/nathanjuicebox/)**.  I was also a founding member of Mistapes Records, Western University's student-run record label.  The label is structured to provide students with the experience of working for a real record label.  In Mistapes's first year, I operated as executive producer for *Inopia*, **[Sam Hansell's](https://www.instagram.com/ham_sansell/)** debut record.  The album released with a sold-out show and fans who already knew the lyrics.  

I grew up in the western consumerist church, which gave me an early distaste for both capitalism and religion.  I commited the terrible sin of deconstructing my faith, which was the best thing I have ever done.  Once I designed my own belief system from the ground up, I felt as if I had just discovered free will.  David Hume was my introduction to philosophy, and from him I was able to understand morals more accurately than religion could have ever taught me.  With the help of my pastor Dr Jon Korkidakis, I was able to understand theism properly, and correct my assumptions about God.  Once meeting Neil Sinhababu, I knew for certain that I would live a great life if I could become a teacher of philosophy.  I am curently working to pivot from the music industry to the world of academia, and nothing in my life has felt more right.
