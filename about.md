Whenever there's music playing, I'm compelled to listen actively.  It's the most distracting thing in the world, but it's also why I've fallen in love with recorded music as an art form.  I love listening to things that confuse me, and force me to learn how to understand it.  This led me to love abstract, intricate genres that can mix storytelling, experimental production styles, and rich musical tradition.  *[Red Burns](https://standingonthecorner.bandcamp.com/album/red-burns)* is my favourite album ever for these reasons; I still don't understand it, but I get closer with each listen.  Red Burns is about the oppressive, addicting challenge of living in a city, but I'm still trying to figure out HOW they expressed it so accurately.  

The longer I exist the more disillusioned I become, but everything has good in it if you look hard enough.  Trying to "make it" in the music scene in London has been the most meaningful, yet painstaking endeavor of my life so far.  Whatever I work on, I try to make it my everything and see it to the end.  I also get too attached to things, often to my own detriment.  Right now, I'm pouring all I have into the record I'm making for Forest City Gallery's **[post-bop beathead workshop](https://www.forestcitygallery.com/post/fcg-s-postbop-beathead-jazz-workshop-sponsored-by-lbmx)**.  

Depression has brought me close to God a few times, and trying to understand these experiences brought me to philosophy.  It answers the 'why's and 'how's better than religion ever could, and I owe my own sanity to the practice.  Philosophy also helped me turn music from my escapism to my inspiration, and now there's nothing more personally fufilling than creating art.  At the end of the day, I'm a community member who gives as much as possible to support art in this city.  I am a record producer, founding member of Mistapes (Western University's student record label), session musician at EMAC and OIART studios, media technician at Village Green Community Church, and a creator of Juice Joint's biweekly jam nights at The Poachers Arms.
