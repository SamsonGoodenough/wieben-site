trying to find ways to make music my life, as ambitiously as possible. If you want to work with me, send me a message through insta or email!  (links below) <br>
I love the intersection of jazz, hip hop, and R&B.  And folk and punk.  Also love psychedelic mixes and electroacoustic engineering techniques.  <br>
<br>
my favourite song is "Enough" by Little Simz
<br>
<br>
im also nonbinary and i love fashion.  my apologies if I accidentially flirt with you.  i love my partner so much and sometimes things we use slip into my vocabulary

Education:<br>
Diploma in Audio Recording Technology from OIART<br>
BA in Popular Music Studies from Western University
