>When you listen to a song, what you’re really listening to is a mix.  The mix determines everything, from what instruments you hear, to how the music makes you feel.  Every popular album has a good mix, but a fantastic and creative mix is what makes the music last.  

**Aiden Wiebe** is a drummer, a guitarist, an arranger, a producer, a recording engineer, a mix engineer, and a mastering engineer.  He does sound engineering both live and in the studio, and performs live at church and other local venues.  At the end of the day, though, he is most comfortable behind the DAW, **tweaking levels to perfection**.  His skills as a multi-instrumentalist give him an appreciation for your specific sound, and the knowledge of how best to present you to the world.  He believes strongly that **every artist should have a unique mix and master that serves their music**.  An interesting, creative master is what makes you **stand out** in an over-saturated market, and it’s what lets you compete with all other professionally mastered records.  

**Aiden** believes that an informed and diverse taste in music is the key to making music that will stand the test of time.  He loves everything from jazz and classical impressionism to hip-hop and funk, but his favourite is 60s-style psychedelia.  He also has a great appreciation for old gear, using analogue tape and other vintage equipment to **nail an authentic sound**.  

**Aiden currently studies popular music at Western University**, in his hometown of London, Ontario.  He has learned **proper engineering practices for recording and mixing live ensembles and bands**, and performs with local R&B group [Phantom Image](https://www.instagram.com/phantomimagemusic/).  He is also a founding member of a **local student-run record label**, currently working as the head of production.
