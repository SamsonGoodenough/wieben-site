*STOMPFEST 2024, MAREK W PHOTOGRAPHY*

My final years at Western weren't spent studying.  Instead, Sam Hansell and I were hiding out in Talbot 345a with a key I "borrowed" from my mastering professor Jay Hodgson.  We crammed harder for the *Inopia* release than we did any exam, enlisted our friends for some torturous recording sessions, and came out of it with a project we could both be proud of.  We released it under *Mistapes*, a student-run record label I founded with my friend and colleague Emanuella Stratas.  Once I graduated, I joined Nathan Nykor's *Juice Joint*.  Our band secured a weekly slot at *The Poachers Arms*; our open jams became the centre of London's growing jazz scene.  We made an album, played *Sunfest* and signed to indie label *Lovetown Records* all in the span of a year.  After this, I begged *Whine Problem* to engineer their release EP.  It was recorded in the same space as *Inopia*, but *Sleem* sounds completely different.  I started experimenting with different recording techniques, with the goal of capturing the emotion of their live performances.  All the while, I was working on an instrumental vinyl LP, which is now being released by Forest City Gallery (hurry up guys!!!! <3)

Once a mental health crisis knocked me out of Juice Joint, I instantly applied to OIART (Ontario Institute of Audio Recording Technology).  I've already been a part of 6 different production projects there, one of which was released as Briefcase (Juice Joint single).  The rest will be released in due time.  TO BE CONTINUED 1st semester starts in september
