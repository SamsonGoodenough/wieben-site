Hi All.
I'm trying something different for this release.  Big album rollouts will normally try to maximize hype and minimize spoilers.  The biggest artists can do something as small as change their profile picture, and the fans will theorize for days.  As a small artist though, there's nothing more annoying than trying to hype up something that nobody yet cares about.  I'd rather be honest about the state of the project, so the people who actually care can follow along with my process.

The cover art is almost certainly going to change.  The album name might even change.  I'm currently hoping for a January release, but that will probably change too.  Ever since I was 13 I've been thinking of what my first album will sound like.  But now, *Awareness* is settling into something I never could have imagined.  Listening outside of my comfort zone and meeting incredible musicians through Western has broadened my horizons well beyond anything my teenage self could envision.  

*Awareness*, originally called *Thanksgiving*, was an idea I had with Manny Thomas.  We wanted to perform and record an improv session with all our musician friends, mainly just for fun.  As I brought song ideas to Manny, we realized they had the potential to be something more ambitious.  The current plan is to improvise on these songs in the studio, and edit the recordings down into a 40 minute album.  We are planning on having 7 tracks, however we may cut some or add some depending on what we come up with in the studio.  **Pearl and Hermes Atoll**, which has already been released, has since been reworked and will be included on the album.  

Every track will have congas or aux percussion, and the wah pedal will stay on the whole time.  *Awareness* prioritizes rhythm and timbre, but thats not to say it won't have cool harmony and melodies too.  I'm aiming for somewhere between *Saucerful of Secrets* by Pink Floyd, *On the Corner* by Miles Davis, Gilberto Gil's self titled albums, and the first three Funkadelic records.  I want to have that 'anything goes' mentality found in late 1960s psychedelia, and the influence that psychedelia had on Jazz, Soul, and MPB.  I'll record to tape whenever possible, and use adventurous stereo mixing techniques like the earliest stereo records.  Overall, I'm hoping to elevate the 'feel' of improvised music with heavy-handed editing and effects.  

Thank you for reading this far.  Hopefully this article has been more enjoyable than had I posted a blank Instagram story with a countdown clock.  This album is not going to appeal to everyone, I will not be offended if you perfer cleanly-produced hi-fi bangers to my sludgy noodlings.  If, however, this does sound like music you'd like, follow my [Bandcamp](wieben.bandcamp.com/) for emails or my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wiebenmusic/) for content.
