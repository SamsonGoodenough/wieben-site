Jesus had it right when he said the way to live a good life is to love God with all of your heart, mind, and soul, and to love others as you love yourself.  Now, I can't believe in God, but even without the religious implications of this message, you will find the best blueprint for living a meaningful life.  

*"But God is an essential part of this message!  You can't just avoid it."*

To understand this correctly, you have to understand how God relates to the self.  Take the second half of the quote by itself.  "Love others as you love yourself".  But what if you don't love yourself?  What if you're depressed and practice self harm?  This is good advice if you do, in fact, love yourself, but it is not universally applicable.  The way you make this work universally, is by loving God.  A depressed person cannot love God.
