<h3>FREE MIXES! WHAAAT!!!</h3>
This means if you are curious about working with me, but have yet to go into the studio, you can send your old multitracks to hear my mixing style, and see if it works with your vision.  

SO!

**Phase 1:**
I import your multitracks into ProTools (perhaps with some analog reamping or digital processing in Max8).  During this phase, I welcome critiques or ideas on any WIP mixes (.mp3s).  I am most concerned with making a mix that amplifies the strengths of the song- not one that is crystal clear (though often clarity is what a song needs).  Once I feel the mix is complete, I will send you two copies.  I will send a final (.wav) and a premaster also (.wav).  The final mix is set to Spotify's LOUD measurement of -11db LUFS.  The premaster is provided in case the song is to be included on an EP or album; I'd suggest mastering the entire project together to avoid hearing issues between tracks.  

**Phase 2:**
You listen to the wav on an iphone and tell me you can't hear the bass.  Or you take it into the car, and tell me it hits like shit.  Or you listen in your home studio, and tell me there's too much mud around 500hz, or that you don't want to hear the compressor pumping the cymbals.  However detailed the direction, I'm happy to accept pay and work on revising the mix until you are happy.  

<h5>$15 CAD per half hour of revising, rounded up to the nearest half hour.  </h5>

<h3>orrr... go 50 DOLLARS MODE</h3>
If I'm bogged down by free mix jobs, or I run out of meds and I'm balling my eyes out, **50 DOLLARS** will make all my troubles go away.  I'll work on your song first, and as a bonus, I'll add in 1 free mix revision during phase 1.  I welcome feedback on a WIP revision (.mp3) until delivering a final revision (.wav) and a premaster (.wav)

Phase 2 remains the same, at $15 CAD per half hour of revising.

<h3>The Project Master</h3>
**Phase 1:** I will ensure your tracks are levelled out, and then I will introduce dynamics to help build energy section-by-section.  I will create seamless track transitions, potentially editing intros/outros to improve the flow between tracks and maintain rhythmic continuity.  Everything will be set to match to the lowest provided sample rate.  (If you want anything greater than 44.1 kHz, don't send me 44.1 kHz!)  

I will share wip .wav files of the entire project to get your opinion on any transitions I have edited, and the overall balance.  This is the time to share nitpicky feedback, and I will wait here until you have listened to the WIP master and shared all of your thoughts.  

**Phase 2:** At this point, I will get extremely nitpicky and will listen on different days and in different environments to ensure all frequencies are as clear as I can get them.  In the end, I will deliver a zip file including:

1. The entire project, seperated track-by-track as .wav files.  These are mastered for streaming at -11dB LUFS.  
2. A single wav file mastered at a different loudness standard, suitable for physical distribution.  The bass will be specifically altered to suit vinyl record limitations.  
3. Seperated track files, also suitable for physical distribution.  

If for some reason you perfer one of the WIP versions, I will still export it for you too, but I will not make any further revisions.
